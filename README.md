This is an R extension supporting access to MongoDB.

After unpacking to C:\mongo-r-driver, drop mongo-c-driver's src directory into mongo-r-driver/rmongodb/src

The driver is installed into R with:
C:\mongo-r-driver> R CMD INSTALL rmongodb

Once this is done, the package may be loaded from within R like any other.
